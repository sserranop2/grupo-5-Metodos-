title:	Catalogue of unfiltered x-ray spectra from tungsten-, molybdenum-, and rhodium-anode-based x-ray tubes with generating voltages from 10kV to 50kV in steps of 1kV
summary: Set of experimental unfiltered x-ray spectra in the range of mammography qualities. The spectra can be computationally filtered to generate a wide range of x-ray spectra in this energy range.

description of the individual files: Three sets of spectra are given, one for each x-ray tube anode. Each set contains 41 unfiltered spectra, with generating voltages from 10kV and 50kV in steps of 1kV. Each file has two columns, the energy (for the top of the bin) is given in the first column, and the normalised fluence in the second. The fluence is normalised to the total fluence and the bin width (in keV)
